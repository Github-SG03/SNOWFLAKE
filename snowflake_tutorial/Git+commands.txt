Git Commands:

1) To initialize/start git
	git init

2) To clone the repository(to make copy of the repository to our local machine & perform all the operation from this loaction onwards)
	git clone <repo-link>//https://github.com/Github-SG03/SF_2024

3) To switch to other branch if needed(you need to first check in which branch you already present--git branch & if we have to login to other branch then--git checkout <branch_name>)
	git checkout dev

-- Now add/modify the content from any IDE or Desktop

4) To view all the uncommitted changes(to find list of files get modified(if any) like addition, deletion etc)
	git status

5) To add the changes after adding/modifying the content in the modified files
	git add .
	
6) To commit the changes
	git commit -m "Comments"
	
7) To push the changes to Github(from local machine)
	git push -- by default it pushesh the changes to the branch we are currently in
	git push <branch-name> -- To push the changes to specified branch
	
8) To merge the changes to main/master branch 
   git merge main/master 
   
(In genearl we may not have access to merge to main/master branch directly, so we have to create a pull request and get it approved by the lead or the one who has approval permission and then merge it to main/master branch)
(so these are the commands we need to know before deploying the github changes to git repository/to work with github )
